System Architecture
Architectural Design
The AI Orchestrator is a cloud-native, document-driven GenAI backend that extracts structured information from uploaded files, maps it to business objects, identifies actions, and invokes existing backend APIs — all powered by Azure OpenAI and deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
1. Deployment Environment
Environment Type
	Description
	Cloud (OCI)
	All workloads are hosted in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
	OKE (Kubernetes)
	FastAPI orchestrator, Kafka workers, ChromaDB are containerized and deployed on Oracle Kubernetes Engine
	Azure Cloud
	Azure OpenAI GPT-4o model is accessed remotely via API
	External
	Okta (Authentication provider) and AWS MKS (CDC pipeline) are integrated as managed services
	

 High-Level System Components
1. Angular UI (Enhanced)
* Hosts the chatbot panel for document upload and user feedback

* Sends API calls to FastAPI orchestrator

* Presents extracted/mapped data and feedback UI

2. FastAPI Orchestrator (Core Service)
   * /extract: Sends document content to Azure OpenAI for field extraction

   * /map: Maps extracted fields to internal schema using YAML-based rules(Mapping System)

   * /identify: Identifies document intent or required action

   * /invoke: Calls existing Spring Boot APIs with prepared payload

   * Validates JWT from Okta and derives tenant context

3. Spring Boot Microservices
      * Existing business logic endpoints (order creation, invoice update, etc.)

      * Orchestrator calls these services using secured REST APIs

      * Hosted on OCI within same private VCN

4. Object Storage (OCI)
         * Stores uploaded documents (PDF) under tenant-scoped prefixes

         * Temporary storage; cleanup happens via offboarding routine

5. Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o)
            * Processes document content (PDF→ JSON)

            * Called directly from FastAPI using key stored in OCI Vault

6. OCI Vault
               * Manages secrets like OpenAI API keys, Okta issuer info, Spring API auth

               * Accessed via Instance Principals by services running in OKE

7. Observability (OCI Monitoring & Logging)
                  * OpenTelemetry-based traces for each FastAPI endpoint

                  * Custom metrics (latency, error rate, token usage)

                  * Fluent Bit sends structured logs to OCI Logging

 Supporting Components
8. Helm + Terraform
                     * Helm: Deploys FastAPI, ChromaDB, probes, and envs on Kubernetes

                     * Terraform: Provisions infrastructure (OKE, Vault, NSGs, Registry)

9. CI/CD Pipeline
                        * GitHub Actions for image builds, Helm-based deploys to OKE

                        * Canary rollout enabled per environment with auto-rollback

Component Design
Detail the architecture of individual components/modules of the system.
1. Frontend (Angular)
        •        Integrated into the existing web application.
        •        Users upload documents and interact via a chatbot-like interface.
        •        Sends files and queries to FastAPI endpoints on the orchestrator.


2. FastAPI Orchestrator (OKE)
        •        Receives user input and documents.
        •        Calls Azure OpenAI to extract structured data from text.
•        Maps extracted fields using pre-defined transformation rules based on the  Tenant.
        •        Calls existing Spring Boot APIs for order creation, validation, etc.
        •        Validates Okta JWTs and enforces tenant-level access control.


3. Spring Boot Microservices (OCI)
        •        Already deployed in the ecosystem.
        •        Handle core business operations like order creation, invoice processing.
        •        Now invoked via FastAPI instead of only the frontend.
4. Azure OpenAI
        •        Called by FastAPI for:
        •        Document field extraction (via LLM completion).
        •        (In future: embeddings and similarity search.)
        •        Responses are parsed and transformed before downstream calls.
5. OCI Vault
        •        FastAPI and workers use Instance Principals to fetch:
        •        Azure OpenAI keys
        •        Okta details
        •        DB credentials
        •        Secrets are not hardcoded or manually managed.
6. OCI Object Storage
        •        Uploaded documents are stored temporarily for parsing and audit trail.
        •        Supports versioning and automatic cleanup during tenant offboarding.
7. ChromaDB on OKE
        •        Deployed via Helm inside the OKE cluster.
        •        (For future expansion) Stores vector embeddings for similarity search.


8. CI/CD
        •        GitHub Actions → OCI Registry → Helm-based rollout to OKE.
        •        Terraform is used for reproducible infrastructure setup and tenant onboarding.

Database Interface
Internal Interface: Oracle Database (via CDC + Schema Mapping)
The AI Orchestrator interacts indirectly with the Oracle database to support document-to-action workflows. It does not perform direct reads/writes during runtime but relies on change streams (CDC) and offline schema discovery to support embedding and mapping logic.
1. Oracle Database (Transactional System of Record)
Purpose:
Stores the ground truth for orders, contracts, invoices, and related entities. Acts as the upstream data source for embedding and semantic search.


Role
	Purpose
	AWS DMS
	Capture change data (insert/update) from Oracle tables
	Embedding Worker (Kafka)
	Consumes Oracle CDC messages via AWS MKS → generates embeddings
	Engineering Team
	Reads schema, joins, and sample data to define mapping rules
	Spring Boot APIs
	Perform actual business operations like order creation/updating
	Tables Involved:
Not sure as of now(should be included)

	SQL queries
	Used to build initial mapping schema/rules
	Usage in Mapping Engine

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Every request must be scoped to a specific tenant_id, derived from the JWT claims.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Data stored (e.g., vector embeddings, uploaded files) must be namespaced or partitioned by the tenant.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Actions like /invoke must enforce tenant checks before calling backend APIs.
3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Different roles (e.g.,based on our System Profile roles, security admin, ar role) should determine which endpoints a user can access and which actions they can trigger.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * RBAC rules must be enforced in FastAPI at the route level using a policy middleware.
4. Secrets Management
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * No secrets should be hardcoded or stored in config files.
